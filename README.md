# JS - Opposites Attract

## Instructions:

Timmy and Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals, it means they are in love.
Write a function that takes the number of petals of each flower and returns true if they are in love and false if they are not.

Example function:
function isLove(petalsFlower1, petalsFlower2) {}

## Requirements:

- The following use cases should be tested.

Input:
1) Timmy: 1 / Sarah: 4
2) Timmy: 2 / Sarah : 2
3) Timmy: 0 / Sarah : 1
4) Timmy : 0 / Sarah : 0
Output:
1) true
2) false
3) true
4) false
